title: Pi4Py - Intermediate Python in 4 Sitting
description: Conducted an online Python course.
---

The idea came to my mind due to some of my friends who thought they were lagging because they didnâ€™t learn Python in their curriculum. This is certainly not true. I always believed that learning a language is more than enough. Keeping that in mind, I wanted to establish the truth by showing how easy it is to master a new language after we already know any other language. 

I asked one of my close friend, [Kaustav,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/commandantekaustav/){:target="_blank"} to come along and together we ran this 4 sitting course (_13th June to 3rd July, 2021_) 

Here we didnot bothered about introducing programming concepts, rather we wanted to taught "How to learn a new language". So we designed the course content in such way that we soon able to show some exclusive feature of Python. By the end, we were happy, because we covered almost all the topics we intended to do, except the image handling.

Topics we covered:

 - On the very first day, we covered upto the intrinsic data structures(like list, tuple, dictionary)
 - In our second sitting we demonstrated Some applications of Dictionary, some aspect of ternary operator and RegEx.
 - In the sitting 3, we introduced participants with NumPy, a bit of Pandas(just to read and write excel file) and some aspect of Matplotlib and imshow.
 - Finally, in the closing session, we talked about the art of debugging. We also discussed Recursion as a brut force method (illustrated with Hanoi Tower problem) and introduce recursion as a route to Dynamic Programming(DP). We also applied principle of DP to calculate Hermite Polynomials optimally from the recursion relation.
 - In the final session session hand-outs, we also added a very basic method to use FuncAnimation with a example of Quantum Harmonic Oscillator(Assuming the solution).
