An ordinary guy who is willing to learn "a lot of things". Currently, I'm doing my master's in Physics. I've got an interest in the Theoretical aspect of the subject in general. To be specific, I'm willing to learn more about Mathematical and Computational Physics. The final goal is to study different and variety of phenomena, from sub-atomic scale to light-year scale, in the light of mathematical model and to understand the Physics behind that!

I also enjoy good music. Though I have a very weird type of music taste. "Weird" in the sense it ranges from hard rock to classical music. 

I also like to spend time writing blogs and tutorials.
