The whole game of Quantum Mechanics is about finding out the probability! On the other hand, Statistical Mechanics may be put on the equal foot, although the context is a littile different. But, both the cases, deal with probabilistic approach(Atleast to the Born Oppenheimer interpretation). Whenever these two high-achiver intertwind, something beautiful happen. We get all sort of useful useful results as the by product. And an interesting quantity appear, known as 'Density Matrix'. Perhaps it is possible to study Quantum mechanical systems statistically without introducing *Density Matrix*, nevertheless, it simplifies many thing and it is reach in concept.

Suppose, one starts heating up a silver coil. The electrons coming out of the foil, can only have two spin states either spin up or down. In the electron beam, coming out of the foil, the spin orientation of an arbitrary choice of an \\(e^-\\) is completely random, therefore known as *random state*. Now, say, we introduce an instrument to polarize the \\(60\%\\) of the electron to be in spin up state atong z-axis and \\(40\%\\) in spin down state. This kind of system is said to be in *mix state*. We could have polarize all the electrons in either direction, say in up state, then it would be known as *pure state*.
